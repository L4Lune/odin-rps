**Plan**

<X> Create a computer player that selects rock, paper, or scissors randomly
<X> Create a function that gets players input
<X> Create a function that plays a single round of rock, paper, scissors
    It takes two parameters (the player choice and the computers choice)
    The function needs to take the player choice and be readable regardless of case (take the input and make it lower case)
<X> Based on what the player and computer plays, display a win or lose message
<> Create a game function that plays five rounds using the single round function
<> Based on the five rounds, keep score using some return value (make the win or lose message be a variable that gets returned and is the input to another function??)
    and after the five rounds display a win or lose message
